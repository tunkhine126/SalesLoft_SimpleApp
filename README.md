## SalesLoft: Build a simple web app 
This app will use the SL API to display a list of people. The goal is to always have a finished product ready to be improved upon with new features.

This web application uses the SalesLoft API to build two distinct features.

- It shows a list of People from records made available from the SalesLoft API and a supplied API key. The list displays each persons name, email address, and job title. 

- A button was created that, when clicked, displays a frequency count of all the unique characters in the email addresses from list of persons. The list is sorted by frequency count. 

Live application can be found [here](https://salesloftsimple-web-app.web.app/)

## Frameworks
 Front end - React
 
 Styling - Bootstrap and custom CSS
 
 Hosting - Firebase 

## Acknowledgements 
I'm appreciative of the HR and Engineering teams at SalesLoft for allowing me the opportunity to showcase some of my knowledge acquired at Flatiron School. Additionally, big big thanks to my Wife for her support and encouragement. 

This app certainly presented some new challenges but if there is one thing I learned in school, it was transforming from a mediorce "googler" to a precise "googler".
